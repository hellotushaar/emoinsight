# EmoInsight - Mood-Based Food & Music Recommender

This is the frontend for a web application that recommends food and music to users based on their mood, which is determined by analyzing a photo of their face.

## Core Features

- A clean, modern, and engaging user interface.
- A camera module to capture a user's photo.
- Dynamic display of results (food and music recommendations) after a simulated mood analysis.

## How To Use

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Click on the "Start Camera" button and allow the browser to access your camera.
3.  Once the camera feed appears, click the "Scan My Mood" button.
4.  The application will simulate an analysis and present you with food and music recommendations based on a randomly determined mood.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including Flexbox for layout and custom properties for theming.
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: For all interactivity, DOM manipulation, and camera access.

No external libraries or frameworks (e.g., jQuery, React, Vue) are used in this project.
